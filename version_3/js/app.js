/* 

CURRENT ISSUES

1 - loading data before google signin. Need to have original page
just display the login button and current time. Once user is signed
in then the information should display. 

2 - should be fixed by button so that there is not a pop up. 
browsers aren't liking the pop up. Not a long term solution, but 
reasonable for now. 

3 - need a way to add data to user

4 - need to only display the users data not all data
